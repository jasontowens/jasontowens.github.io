          <h2>Jason Owens</h2>
          <p>A programmer passionate about creative development and exploring new possibilities, I have a keen interest in all things related to how computer science collides with the real world. I enjoy making things from scratch using all types of technologies and am particularly interested in game development and virtual/augmented reality. Outside of work, I spend a lot of my time trying to understand the world and my role in it, though have a tendency to spread myself too thin. I value my friends, my family, and my coworkers, and am actively working to better balance my relationship between life and work. I’m still undecided about exactly what I want to do for a living, but if money was non-issue I would almost definitely go into video game development or some other culturally creative pursuit. I’m a computer science major taking DAS for interest, and have been happy about it so far.  </p>

          <h2>Sahar Kausar</h2>
          <p>My name is Sahar (which means Dawn in Urdu / Moon in Hebrew). I’m a Digital Arts and Sciences Engineering major and I have an interest in 3D modeling and animation, creative/innovative software programing, 2D traditional art with anything related to the gaming, film, or creative technical industry and more. I enjoy DAS engineering as it is a means for me to challenge both sides of the learning spectrum and my brain (the logical and creative). I’m currently a 3D modeling intern and wish to animate for a company in either the video-gaming or film industry as well as write/publish a book one day. I enjoy learning and speaking languages and can currently speak five and hope to travel the world too and immerse myself in new cultures. I have a love for the animals and have a pet hedgehog and I am fostering a cat that was a rescue. I have enjoyed what we’ve been learning in the course and hope to continue to improve my skills!

          <h2>Leslie Richardson</h2>
          <p>I’m a third-year computer engineering major with an interest in digital arts and sciences.  I love utilizing my creativity and problem-solving to solve out-of-the-box challenges in relation to programming.  When I’m not coding, I can be found reading, graphic-designing, and enthusiastically talking about all things Disney.  I would like to pursue a career working on web development, gaming, or GUI-related projects, and my dream job is to become a Disney Imagineer.  DAS electives have given me the opportunity to apply my passions for art and math, and is a great balance to my more conceptual-based classes.

          <h2>Justin Macedo</h2>
          <p>I am Junior in Computer Engineering and I have a huge interest for game development. I enjoy using programming techniques I have learned to implement various gaming projects. My dream job is to work for a big name video game corporation such as Naughty Dog or Bungie. I like taking DAS electives to get a better understanding of computer graphics and its role in game development. In my free time I play video games and skate around campus. I am always looking to learn more about software development in order to achieve my goal. </p>
